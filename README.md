# Toggle Extension

Toggle Extension is a cross-browser framework for extensions that enable and disable extra interactive elements, such as tooltips or panels. Its basic code can be easily customized and scaled to create limitless extensions.

## Getting Started

```
svn export https://github.com/nil/toggle-extension/trunk/extension
```
This will only download the `extension` folder of this repository. Alternatively, you could clone all this repository with `git clone` and delete the extra folders.

*Right now it is the best option, in my option, to download the files. I'm working to add an npm command in the future.*
